  With the semester coming to a close, students are moving out of their dorms and final exams are taking up everyone’s time. For many music fans, it’s nice to reminisce on the concerts they went to over the past few months, but here at WMUC we’re thinking about our Third Rail bands.
  <br>
  <br>
	This semester was full of firsts: the first full term where we allowed people to come to the station to watch shows live and the first live-mixed Third Rail with our new state-of-the-art recording technology, which also allowed us to create higher quality content on our YouTube channel. 
  <br>
  <br>
	There were 10 episodes of Third Rail this semester with 18 up-and-coming guest bands, both local and from out of town. Some were just starting out, with their first live set being on Third Rail, and some seasoned performers as well.
  <br>
  <br>

<div class="bandhed">Dollgrith</div>
<i>For Fans of: Alex G, Fiona Apple, Field Medic</i>
<br>
<br>
	Dollgrith is the newly-implemented solo project of Baltimore musician Jen Watson. Previously, she’s worked on various projects with bands both in Baltimore and the DMV like Combat, Honey Stomach, and most recently, God Forgive this Dog, who played their first show with Watson on Dec. 15 in Rockville.
  <br>
  <br>
	Watson released Dollgrith’s first single “Endless Stomachs (Cerridwen)” on July 28. A haunting, entrancing romp that seems a little folk-inspired, her only song out sums up her Third Rail performance perfectly. The drummer by trade took a very minimalistic approach to her set— armed with only her acoustic guitar and 20 minutes of unreleased music, her style is marked best by lilting, but supported, vocals and intricate picking, showing her breadth as a musician. Watson made her return on Third Rail on Nov. 12 playing drums for Honey Stomach.

<div class="bandhed">Pamphlets</div>
<i>FFO: Protomartyr, Lifeguard, Parquet Courts</i>
<br>
<br>
Traveling nearly 3 hours to get to the little room above South Campus Dining Hall, Pamphlets had plenty of time to workshop how their performance was going to go. Beginning with a song not yet posted to streaming, they left the audience in suspense before playing their first release, “It Feels Like,” which has amassed over 15,000 listens on Spotify since its release in November 2021. Their sound was droning but danceable, not dissimilar to a Parquet Courts number. 
<br>
<br>
Since Pamphlets’ inception in 2021, they’ve been playing shows around the east coast, sharing the stage with hyper-local stars in the Brooklyn scene like HYPEMOM and Deep Sea Peach Tree. 
<br>
<br>
Fun fact: Pamphlets’ hometown of Brooklyn, NY is the furthest away from WMUC than any other Third Rail band this semester.
<br>

<div class="datehed"><div id="oct-8">Oct. 8</div></div>
<div class="bandhed">Panasi</div>
<i>For Fans of: Redveil, MIKE</i>
<br>
<br>
Just two weeks before his Third Rail set on Sept. 22, Panasi released his latest single, “Rose Petaled Blunt.” 
<br>
<br>
Melodic rap and R&B has been his game since he was in high school, releasing his first single, “Dreams,” in 2021, when he was just 16. It gave him a local claim to fame at Watkins Mill High School in Gaithersburg, and since his graduation in 2023, he has only grown as an artist, releasing two singles and playing local shows around the DMV.
His show was lowkey— he sat on a stool next to his laptop, holding the mic without a stand, keeping the vibe very understated and relaxing. 
<br>
<br>
<div class="bandhed">Talking to Shadows</div>
<i>For Fans of: Cocteau Twins, Strawberry Switchblade</i>
<br>
<br>
	Founded in 2018 in Baltimore, Talking to Shadows has carefully curated an ethereal shoegaze sonic aesthetic in their music. With four releases under their belt, including their most recent EP Lost, which came out in July, they’ve amassed a local following, and even a spot at New Colossus Festival in New York City alongside D.C. native and Third Rail alumni band Flowers for the Dead. 
  <br>
  <br>
	Talking to Shadows is not your everyday shoegaze, they also implement elements of noise rock with lots of fuzz on their instruments, as well as looping samples reminiscent of more experimental music. Vocalist Cat Van Glide also takes an interesting approach to singing— utilizing a gentle gratingness almost like Dolores O’Riordan from The Cranberries.

<div class="bandhed">Insatiable High</div>
<i>For Fans of: Tame Impala, King Gizzard and the Lizard Wizard</i>
<br>
<br>
	Baltimore new wave band Insatiable High released their first full length album, Feel This Way, just nine days before their Third Rail performance. Their floating, trippy sound is best marked by dreamy synths and faraway vocals by Gunnar Isbert. 
  <br>
<br>
	Packed into the little space that the WMUC live room hosts, the band managed to fit a two-tiered MIDI keyboard manned by Chris Ritter, guitarist Kim Te, and Isbert’s sampling pad in front of the drum kit. They played songs from their new album, including the titular track “Feel This Way” off of their new album, which they released a music video for on Dec. 1.
  <br>
  <br>
<div class="bandhed">Neen Fleezy</div>
<i>For Fans of: XXXTentacion, Juice WRLD</i>
<br>
<br>
Alone with his guitar in the center of the room, Neen Fleezy’s Third Rail was a pared-down version of his typical rap sound. With little production on his guitar and no beat machine in sight, he was just rapping over his chords— an interesting sight to see and a good glimpse into what goes into the creation of songs like this.
<br>
<br>
	Even though it didn’t sound exactly like the songs he has out on streaming, his performance was intimate and provided a new sound to Third Rail.
<br>
<br>

<div class="datehed"><div id="oct-22">Oct. 22</div></div>
<div class="bandhed">Jem Wilde</div>
<i>For Fans of: Sidney Gish, Leith Ross</i>
<br>
<br>
	Hailing from George Mason University, Jem Wilde brought only their guitar to the WMUC Live Room. Their music is best described as intimate bedroom pop, where the bedroom in question is a single dorm room. Yeah. That close. 
  <br>
<br>
	Their performance at WMUC was equally intimate— they sat on a stool with their guitar and a bright pink shirt inspired by Elle Woods from Legally Blonde. The audience was all sitting criss-cross applesauce watching on. Their set only consisted of their original music, but they are very active on Instagram and TikTok, posting covers of artists like Phoebe Bridgers, Daffo, and Taylor Swift.

<br>
<br>
<div class="bandhed">Halisca</div>
<i>For Fans of: sundots, Sweet Trip</i>
<br>
<br>
	“Halisca is Naomi James. Halisca is all you got,” reads the Spotify bio for this revolutionary artist, and what an apt way to describe such a nomadic project. Halisca’s arrival to WMUC was much anticipated due to her regional acclaim as an experimental artist in Baltimore. Her sound flies around, hitting handfuls of genres in its pillage— from electronica and hyperpop to lofi and punk— each one executed with near-perfection. 
  <br>
<br>
	Given this breadth in discography, we weren’t sure what to expect from James’ show. After technical difficulties with a broken sampler, which took down her ability to use her signature vocal effects, she decided on a set with just guitar and raw vocals, and wouldn’t you know it, it sounded amazing— new life was breathed into tracks like “Gone 2 Sleep,” a single released back in February.
  <br>
<br>
	Over a snack-sized bag of Flamin’ Hot Cheetos in the broadcasting studio, we discussed Halisca’s arc: where is she going? What will she do next? We were given a vague answer, but finally saw something on Dec. 5, when she released a split with Virginia band Sheetrock titled Halisca and Sheetrock Discover America, where she delves into a more garage rock sound.  (We recommend "598 W 28th")

<div class="bandhed">Fantazma</div>
<i>For Fans of: Teen Mortgage, Generacion Suicida</i>
<br>
<br>
Bilingual D.C. band Fantazma describes themselves as “post-something.” The amalgamation of punk riffs, fuzzy effects, and lively vocal lines, their sound is one that’s truly unique and hard to put one’s finger on. In March of this year, they released their first full release, an EP called ¡Candela!, which provided the basis for most of their Third Rail set.

<div class="bandhed">Baby Photos</div>
<i>For Fans of: Beach Bunny, Clairo</i>
<br>
<br>
Baby Photos is dreamy indie pop for little babies. And apparently, WMUC’s Third Rail Staff is a bunch of babies, because this was one of our staff favorite shows. The Frederick band currently only has one song out on streaming, “Cut Me Out,” released in January. Their Third Rail performance, as a result, was almost completely comprised of new and unreleased music.

<div class="bandhed">Holiday Death Tribute</div>
<i>For Fans of: Waterparks, All Time Low</i>
<br>
<br>
A mere two days before they were set to play Third Rail, D.C. pop-punk band Holiday Death Tribute released their first single, “Practice.” Originating from the mind of Michael Dzambasow, the project started out as him just playing open mics around the District, and has since grown to a full three-piece band playing shows at Slash Run, DC9, and other local venues.
<br>
<br>
Their performance with WMUC was full of unreleased music, including “Hello, Goodbye,” which is scheduled to be released on Dec. 15. 
<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
<div class="bandhed">Tripping Corpse</div>
<i>For Fans of: Bad Brains, Coke Bust
</i>
<br>
<br>
These guys are about as hardcore as WMUC can get. Calling back on Third Rail’s early history of punk musicians, Tripping Corpse brought their heaviest sound to the airwaves for their set. You know they’re really punk because in addition to WMUC, other shows they’ve played have been hosted at random people’s houses and a Pizza Boli’s in Woodbridge, VA.

  <br>
  <div class="pullattribution">- Sarah Zhu, vocalist/guitarist, No Girlfriend</div></blockquote>
  <hr width="100%">  
  <br>
<br>
<br>
It all started as Sarah Zhu practicing alone in the WMUC live room. Her solo project, bombasticchicken, allowed her to put her lyrics “about her failing love life,” as she put it, into the world. 
<br>
<br>
The University of Maryland sophomore computer science student currently has three tracks on Spotify: “untitled!,” which is her first ever single, features her autotuned voice singing original lyrics over a stock beat. Her second song “Stupid Teenage Girl” is where we start to see inklings of the soon-to-be sound of No Girlfriend come into light, with heavy reverbed guitars paired with gentle vocals, and “came in like a ghost,” her most recent, released in October, is the beautiful combination of the two songs which came before it— starting with an ethereal produced voice tone and devolving into weightless alt-rock. 
<br>
<br>
No Girlfriend played their debut show on October 7. The relatively new band is composed of Zhu as well as bassist Maya Mistry and drummer Dhruv Srinivasan. Together they’ve been adapting Zhu’s solo work into a full band while eventually turning to original music. Their Third Rail was only their third ever performance.
<br>
<br>
“I feel so lucky to have met Maya and Dhruv. They are able to like the sound [of bombasticchicken], so we didn’t really need to change the style very much since we like the same music,” Zhu said.
<br>
<br>
<div class="bandhed">Honey Stomach</div>
<i>For Fans of: Florry, Slow Pulp
</i>
<br>
<br>
Honey Stomach is the solo project of Jessie Szegö. Best known for her work in D.C.-based band Flowers for the Dead, Szegö has proved she knows her way around the edgy and heavy. Her work with Honey Stomach, however, is a tribute to her early beginnings in indie pop bands, beginning as early as age 14. 
<br>
<br>
This Honey Stomach performance was unlike any other, though, as Szegö was joined by fellow Third Rail alums Jen Watson of Dollgrith on drums and Alex Matute of Haüser and Colma Kills on bass. What are typically sweet, folksy sounds were given new life with the help of Watson and Matute, making the sound more rounded and developed, but equally as addictive.

<div class="bandhed">Strawberry Sleepover</div>
<i>For Fans of: The Strokes, Thee Oh Sees</i>
<br>
<br>
Having shared the stage with acts like Teen Mortgage and Frankie and the Witch Fingers, Baltimore garage rock band Strawberry Sleepover has had many great acts to study. The band is very ingrained in the Baltimore scene, frequenting Metro BMore, Ottobar, and local festivals like Zest Fest, so it was nice to see them expanding into the DMV. 
<br>
<br>
<div class="bandhed">Scramble</div>
<i>For fans of: Dazey and the Scouts, Limp Wrist</i>
<br>
<br>
At the time of their show, Scramble had almost no digital footprint— no Spotify, no bandcamp, nothing, except for an Instagram with 1500 followers, something nearly unheard of for a band with no music out. What did these 1500 people know that everyone else didn’t?
<br>
<br>
Clearly, that this band goes hard. Scramble is made up of four queers from Baltimore and together they made what may have been the loudest Third Rail to date. Five days later, they released their album, DEMO 23, on Bandcamp.
<br>

  <div class="pullattribution">- Adam Trice, vocalist, Red Sammy</div></blockquote>
  <hr width="100%">  

Red Sammy has been cooking up folksy americana since 2007. The brainchild of frontman Adam Trice, the band has featured a rotating cast of musicians, but always focuses on keeping their music thoughtful and poetic. 
<br>
<br>
“Our band name, Red Sammy, comes from a Flannery O’Connor short story… called <i>A Good Man is Hard to Find,</i>" Trice said in an interview with Third Rail’s directors. “This family goes on vacation, goes down south, and they get this warning that a killer is on the loose. They stop in this barbeque joint called Red Sammy Butts— he makes barbeque and he has this pet monkey chained to a truck, I think. When I read that story my freshman year, I was looking for band names, and I saw ‘Red Sammy’ written on paper and thought, ‘wow.'” 
<br>
<br>
The rest, as they say, is history. Since then, Red Sammy has been featured on the Top Songs of 2018 playlist by WTMD, Baltimore’s independent alternative music station, and have done tours playing live shows for many radio stations, including, of course, WMUC.
<br>
<br>
<div class="bandhed">High-Brid Band</div>
<i>For Fans of: Limp Bizkit, Black Veil Brides</i> 
<br>
<br>
	According to their Spotify, High-Brid Band has found themselves in the same place as many big names, like CAKE at Baltimore’s Artscape and Marlon Wayans at the Apollo Theater in NYC. It all started, though, in 2012, with the release of their first EP, Arrival. 
  <br>
  <br>
	Their most recent release was almost over a year ago: a single called “If I Fall.” The track is still hot though, with almost 150k streams. It’s reminiscent of nu metal almost, yet High-Brid’s influences of Linkin Park, Rise Against and ACDC still shine through.

<i>For Fans of: Weezer, The Smashing Pumpkins</i>
<br>
<br>
They started with a cryptic beginning: an Instagram post of the backs of the band members’ heads on July 7. The caption: “It’s never too late to rally!” 
<br>
<br>
Little is known about The Rally Caps except that they are from D.C., they like to drink beer, they make rock music and they’re alright at it. Their Instagram has 80 followers. They have no music out. Get in on the ground floor.
<br>
<br>
<div class="bandhed">Sleep House</div>
<i>For Fans of: Vampire Weekend, Mt. Joy</i>
<br>
<br>
Last but not least, we have Sleep House. They were another staff favorite— during their set we received a message from our recording studio director that read “This last band for Third Rail is a dub,” which, for you old people out there, is how the kids say something is good.
<br>
<br>
Sleep House is from South Jersey, and is made up of Nick Gardyasz, Adam Mink, Evan and Nick Marcinko. Their claim to fame was their track “Skydiving in Dubai,” a track off of their release High Tide in 2020, which gained around 125,000 streams on Spotify. Since then, they’ve released their EP Forever Joy in July of this year.
